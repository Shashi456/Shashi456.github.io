## Ideas

  - A Universal Healthcare Blockchain - The most important issue we find ourselves in through now, is that healthcare records are a mess. Each time you visit a different doctor, a different set of records have to be maintained either physical or digital if the company has a public EHR system. What if we could make an immutable health record system where in all your health record from a variety of sources are chained onto each other, in a secure manner. It could be treated akin to a wallet in cryptocurrency wherein instead of coins, you have your health records, undersigned by the doctor so tracking him would be easy too. One final extension or application of this idea is the idea of ownership of data, A privacy based data access approach could be implemented which would be used in training AI models. I think such an approach could truly lead towards the democratization of medicine and healthcare for all. 

  - A Github for Githubs or similar portfolio based platforms - While github itself is one of the best ideas to open source projects and showcase projects to recruiters, friends and colleagues alike. Github is mostly code based, and other "talent" hosting platforms like dribble have also come up in the past few years. A github for githubs would look like, a common profile where your "portfolio" can be viewed and you can also probably have the ability to showcase or highlight a few projects. 

  - Content Authentication - We will soon reach a place where in even training models on deepfakes won't be enough to detect original from fake, and so this solution might be an answer for that.
