Today I learnt about turing completeness, what it means to call a machine or a programming language turing complete. 

The idea of turing completeness stems from automata theory. A formal definition of turing complete would be as follows: 
>A computer or a programming language is said to be Turing complete if it can implement a Turing machine or if any system is Turing Equivalent. A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that can, in principle, perform any calculation that any other programmable computer can.  

But in practicality, modern computation machines/programming languages, are called turing complete if they can emulate a turing machine.
