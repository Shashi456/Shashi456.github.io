description: Some thoughts on regulation and crypto

"Run from it, dread it, destiny arrives all the same." - Thanos.

<p>While we have known since the day Bitcoin came into existence that regulation would eventually happen, and though everyone has been predicting the day every month since 2017, the recent call by uniswap to delist a few tokens (derivs and synths) could be seen as the dawn of a choice that creators within crypto will constantly have to make around product design and compliance. This oncoming regulatory action means that some innovatory experiments within the Defi scene n will classify as illegal and go right out the window, hence killing products that otherwise would have seen reality. </p>

Vitalik, in his recent talk at ETHcc, mentioned that, while defi applications are cool until they get up to level 2, when you keep on building on and get up to level 6, this tends to make the financial system unstable, and we should focus on other applications possible. The dawn of regulation within crypto will probably stifle innovation not just in defi but otherwise as well, because would you really want applications with seamless interop with monetary applications not under the purview of the government?

While a few see this as a welcome change towards a more regulatory environment and perhaps with it would come more acceptance worldwide among other "investors" and stability within this volatile asset class, what they don't understand is that the cost of regulation is at the sacrifice of some of our ideals, and what happens if we sacrifice the most important one. 

The question I see that people might ask themselves in the coming month revolves around, "does this reflect the ethos of crypto, or was the permissionless part of crypto just a meme"?. Removing derivatives and synths from a decentralized exchange doesn't count as permissionless access anymore, "b-but the smart-contracts are decentralized you can access them directly" while this might count as a valid rebuttal, how many people do you know who access smart contracts, and how many people do you know willing to touch token pairs which were apparently delisted in the name of regulatory compliance.

While we move towards 2022, we will see a more significant regulatory push towards adding KYC to every aspect of what caused the current wave within crypto, DeFi. This reminds me of the days of BitMEX (the most popular derivatives exchange until early 2020); one of the reasons that it was wildly popular even though they just had a few pairs was because of the relatively good UX and no-KYC and the day they chose to add KYC, it quickly got eclipsed by other exchanges which were better (or were they?). 'Oh, but whoever wants to use a financial application without KYC is probably engaging in criminal activities, 'fails to understand a simple thing. It's about the choice of not having to reveal yourself that makes a sovereign individual; forceful compliance is anything but.  

Do you know that for the first 15-20 years in its existence, derivatives were unregulated in the US? And when someone tried to do it, they steamrolled the person and came out with a paper saying that these products were unregulated for a reason and shouldn't be under the purview of financial regulators; that was until the 2008 meltdown. So is the regulation done on the part of caution and protecting naive investors falling to scams? (Refer to CFMA 2000, which put a stop to all attempts of regulating derivatives.)

Perhaps the next year will see a more considerable rise in the usage of protocols like Perpetual protocol, DyDx, Synthetix because of the sophistication that L2 allows them to achieve. But if they eventually add KYC, will that reflect the choices we've made until now, is there meaning in being decentralized if you are ultimately locked back into the same centralized applications you wanted to forgo? 

I think this tweet rightfully captures the sentiment of the ethos that we embody,

While every crypto cycle, the bull brings froth memes, and the bear brings "in it for the tech" memes, if there's anything we've all always enjoyed within crypto is some degree of pseudonymity. In the bigger picture, this has allowed us to think about unlocking pseudonymous economies, people working decentralized from different parts of the world and getting paid in crypto (our idea of universality - one true global economy, payments without borders), ideas in the cloud, growth through bootstrapping, something we have actually realized through protocols like sushi, alchemix, etc. But what about all the scams? Sure you've had scams, and sure there are manipulations; like they haven't happened in centralized landscapes and as if the biggest banks in the world didn't allow corruption to an extent which would seem paltry to what happens in crypto, a slap on the wrist was all they were given. All economic systems suffer from the tragedy of the commons; rise to corrupt activities is just one side effect. 

Will we look back in 2 years to see a past where we allowed regulators to make defi a plaything for financial institutions, regulating it out of existence eventually wrapping defi in the same bureaucratic red-tape that will slow down innovation, tying them to the same bogged ideals that we sought to escape. Perhaps what defi is destined to become is another meme in the financial markets, or "fintech" as they call it, and presented through the same silly and slow abstractions that centralized (financial or otherwise) institutions suffer from today. I know a few founders who are now afraid to build pseudonymously or otherwise, fearful of the future crackdown not because they are doing something illegal but instead because the regulators are trying to regulate something they understand very little about and might be overly harsh. 

"Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments." - Satoshi Nakamoto [[Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)]

Perhaps a phrase missing in that line was, 'financial institutions backed by governments', What governments across the world are doing with this is, they'll take the "fast P2P transactions globally for cheap" aspect of our ecosystem, implement KYC and all we would have accomplished is accelerate this aspect. Bitcoin/crypto will never achieve its goal, will get regulated to death and become a playtoy of financial institutions, offered through the same abstractions, i.e., products that we so sought to avoid and everyone you know will own bitcoin, everyone will be in crypto and rejoicing, it would seem like we have attained our goal of larger adoption, but I thought the saying went "not your keys, not your coins". The CBDCs of the future aim to push the financial landscape not towards innovation but towards total surveillance and an Orwellian future where everything you do is monitored. "Knowledge is leverage," and what when they know every single aspect of your spending, buying, and saving? The original ethos of crypto will likely remain only on paper.
