description: My research in abstractive summarization.
---
I've been researching in Abstractive Summarization for a pretty long time now. This series of articles is meant for someone to get started into the field and following key intuitive concepts of the papers presented since the advent of the pointer-generator network[1][1]. One thing that sets abstractive summarization a little apart from its counterparts in NLP is the heavy usage of RL, optimizing on ROUGE scores.
